# Blight music video

Music video for my song [Blight]().
It uses metro to setup up a parallax scrolling scene for the duration of the song.

cd blight
bundle

```

### Description

This is a near duplicate of the tutorial that you create at the end of the [ruby tutorial for gosu](https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Ruby-Tutorial). However, if you look at the structure of this project you will find distinct differences and that is because it is using [metro](https://github.com/burtlo/metro) to take care of a lot of the tedious coding tasks.
